## Overview

A comprehensive Go client library for integrating with the Mercado Pago API.

## üí° Requirements

The SDK requires Go 1.x.x or higher.

## üì≤ Installation

First time using Mercado Pago? Create your [Mercado Pago account](https://www.mercadopago.com), if you don't have one already.

Install the Mercado Pago SDK for Go:
```sh
$ go install github.com/mercadopago/sdk-go
```

That's it! The Mercado Pago SDK for Go has been successfully installed.

## üåü Getting Started

Simple usage looks like:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/mercadopago/sdk-go/pkg/config"
	"github.com/mercadopago/sdk-go/pkg/payment"
)

func main() {
	accessToken := "{{ACCESS_TOKEN}}"

	cfg, err := config.New(accessToken)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}

	client := payment.NewClient(cfg)

	request := payment.Request{
		TransactionAmount: 105.1,
		Payer: &payment.PayerRequest{
			Email: "{{EMAIL}}",
		},
		Token:        "{{CARD_TOKEN}}",
		Installments: 1,
	}

	resource, err := client.Create(context.Background(), request)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Println(resource)
}
```

### SDK Configuration

Before making API requests, you need to initialize the SDK with your access token:

```go
	accessToken := "{{ACCESS_TOKEN}}"

	cfg, err := config.New(accessToken)
```

### Making API Requests

To make requests to the Mercado Pago APIs, you can use the packages provided by the SDK. For example, to list payment methods, you can use the `paymentmethod` package:

```go
	client := paymentmethod.NewClient(cfg)
	resources, err := client.List(context.Background())
```

### Exception throwing handling

Every package methods returns two variables: response (type of the package) and error (type of the std lib), which will contain any error thrown. It is important to handle these errors in the best possible way.
```go
	resources, err := client.List(context.Background())
	if err != nil {
		// appropriate treatment
	}
```

For more details on the available methods and request parameters, please refer to the [Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/mercadopago/sdk-go) documentation.
